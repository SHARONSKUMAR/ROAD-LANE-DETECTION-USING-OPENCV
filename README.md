# ROAD-LANE-DETECTION-USING-OPENCV
Using OpenCV, analyze video frames to detect road lanes by applying image processing techniques such as edge detection, Hough transform, and line fitting for lane marking identification and visualization.
In today's world, where autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems are becoming increasingly prevalent, road lane detection plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation. I am proud to have successfully developed a robust and accurate lane detection system using the power of OpenCV.

Using computer vision techniques and OpenCV's extensive library of functions, I have created a solution that can accurately identify and track road lanes in real-time. By leveraging the power of image processing and machine learning, this project aims to enhance road safety and contribute to the development of intelligent transportation systems.
